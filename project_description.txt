Purpose
In this notebook, we explore the application of machine learning techniques for predicting the temperatures of geothermal reservoirs, utilizing hydrogeochemical data. This study exclusively focuses on a regression-based approach, aiming to forecast the temperature of geothermal reservoirs as a continuous numerical value.

Methodology
For the regression analysis, following machine learning models are used,  
1. Linear Regression 
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. ElasticNet Regression
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors
7. Decision Tree
8. Random Forest Regressor

To enhance the accuracy and reliability of our predictions, the study incorporates data preprocessing methods. This involves normalizing the hydrogeochemical data and implementing outlier detection techniques, which are essential for refining the machine learning models' performance. Additionally, a feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the key hydrogeochemical parameters that most significantly influence geothermal reservoir temperatures. This aspect of the study is crucial for gaining deeper insights into the geothermal processes and for further improving the predictive capabilities of the models.

Results
1. The observed dataset exhibits a weak correlation between predictor and response variables, leading to suboptimal performance of linear regression models. The high Mean Square Error (MSE) values indicate a significant deviation of the model predictions from the actual data.
2. A set of eight machine learning algorithms was used to analyze the hydrogeochemical dataset. During both training and testing phases, these models achieved moderate levels of accuracy. Notably, the Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression models demonstrated better performance, achieving MSEs of 0.883 and 0.742, respectively.
3. A correlation analysis revealed that SiO<sub>2</sub>, Na, and Cl concentrations exhibit a relatively strong positive correlation (exceeding 0.2) with geothermal reservoir temperatures, suggesting their potential as predictive indicators in the models.
4. Feature importance ranking analysis identified SiO<sub>2</sub> (measured in mg/L) as the most critical predictor in base cases of both Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
5. Based on their minimal impact on model performance, Boron (mg/L) and Potassium (K, measured in mg/L) were excluded from the dataset, streamlining the feature set for more efficient model training.
6. The predictive accuracy of the machine learning models is anticipated to improve with the integration of additional predictor variables and an expanded dataset, enhancing the models' ability to capture complex relationships within the data.
7. Hyperparameter tuning will be done to look for improvements in model performance.

Suggested next steps
In future, a robust cross-validation strategy could be employed to assess the models' generalizability across various datasets. This will ensure that the predictive models would be applicable and reliable in different geothermal contexts.
